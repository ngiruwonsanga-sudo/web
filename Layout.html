UNIVERSITY OF RWANDA-COLLEGE OF EDUCATION<p></p>
	The University of Rwanda is Rwanda's largest higher education institution. University of Rwanda was formed in 2013 through the merger of previously independent public institutions of higher education, the largest of which was the National University of Rwanda
	
	<marquee direction="left"> <h1>UR Colleges</h1> </marquee>
There are 6 independent, self-governing colleges at The University of Rwanda.
The college system is at the heart of the Universityâ€™s success, giving students and academics the benefits of belonging to both a large, internationally renowned institution and to a smaller, interdisciplinary, academic college community. It enables leading academics and students across subjects and year groups, and from different cultures and countries to come together to share ideas.

All Colleges invest heavily in facilities for extensive library and IT provision, accommodation and welfare support, and sports and social events. The relatively small number of students at each college allows for close and supportive personal attention to be given to the induction, academic development and welfare of individuals.
Each college has its own Governing Body etc.
